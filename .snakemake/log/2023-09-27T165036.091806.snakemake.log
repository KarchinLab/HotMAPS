Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

NameError: The name "'clump_input'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        awk  '{{ print $2, "ndd_out", $4":A" }}' {config['clump_input']} | sort |  uniq -c | awk -v OFS='	' '{{print $2, $3, $4, $1}}' > {output[0]}
